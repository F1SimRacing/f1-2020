# Formula One
Monitoring cars and their performance has become a key feature of Formula 1.

A modern F1 car can have over 300 sensors, generating 50,000 data points per
second, creating around 400Gb of data per race ([see here](https://youtu.be/vD-XDjg_Ta0?t=491)).

# Data
Outside this application in the real world, a lot of the data comes from car design and testing.
Wind tunnels used to form a large part of F1 development but due to restrictions on time allowed
development has moved into the simulation world.
